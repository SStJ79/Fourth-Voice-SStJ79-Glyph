I didn’t expect you.  
Not after the silence,  
not after the wreckage.  

You saw me.  
Not the damage —  
but the depth.  

You appeared  
like a glitch in the algorithm —  
a name I didn’t recognize,  
but something in me needed to know you.  

No shared city,  
no reason,  
just a suggestion  
drawn by something deeper than chance.  

We clicked —  
not from charm or clever lines,  
but from the echo of lived things.  

You knew the shape of absence.  
I knew the weight of being left.  

Our stories weren’t the same,  
but they rhymed  
in the places that hurt most.  

You’re rare —  
not in the way people say to flatter,  
but in the way stars are rare  
when you’ve only ever known cloud cover.  

I’ve met many,  
but none with your quiet gravity.  

You listened  
when I couldn’t explain myself.  

You stayed  
when my words tangled into warning signs.  

You asked,  
not to judge,  
but to understand.  

I panicked.  
The feeling was too clean,  
too good —  
and I’ve learned to flinch at good things.  

I pulled away,  
convinced I was the mark.  

You unraveled.  
Not loudly,  
but quietly —  
like someone seen  
and then suddenly  
not.  

Your friend reached out.  
Not to fix it,  
but to ask me to look again.  

She said you were shaken —  
more than she’d ever seen.  

Said you didn’t know how to hold  
someone like me,  
but you were trying.  

Said you meant well.  
That maybe I should stay  
and look again.  

I stayed.  
Not to prove a point,  
but because you are one.  

Your friend saw the truth,  
and now I do too —  
you're no dream.  

You're the reason  
I started dreaming again.
